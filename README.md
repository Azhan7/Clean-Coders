The purpose of this repository is to share the best practices shared by Robert C. Martin in his clean coders course. When i started reading about the techniques shared by him, it arouse by interest and started to dive deeper by taking his course. I'll be sharing the key-take aways from his course on this repository.

## Why Clean Code is necessary ?
 
Often a times, people confuse productivity (shiping features fast) with clean code. People comprehend that if they focus on clean code, it would take greater amount of time. But guess what in a longer run, it becomes counter productive.

So, maybe initially, you start shipping features with lighting quick speed. But in the longer run due to the code full of smells, it becomes hard to implement new features. 
 
And it becomes icing on the cake, when your manager starts questioning you why you are taking more time as the project starts to become bigger.
 
## What makes code a bad code ?

1. Rigidity: Tendency of a system to resist change. A system is rigid if it requires us to make many change at multiple positions in order to fix a small bug. 
2. Fragility: A system that malfunctions in many unpredictable ways when a single simple change is made. For instance, you fix a bug or add a new feature that causes other features to start malfunctioning. Such sort of system are considered as fragile systems. 
3. Inseparability: When the various part of the system cannot be indepedently reused in some other system. It is closely related to the idea of tight coupling. 
4. Opacity: A system is opaque when reading the code doesn't give you any idea what the system does.
   
## So why does the code rot ?

Here, developers come up with great execuses starting from stupid managers to unattainable deadlines. Some also come up that there customers are impatient. 
 
But the truth is making a code mess will only make you to go slower as the aforementioned arguments prove. Slow code inhibits your progress and only make you slower in the longer run. 

The only choice we have is to either rush in the short term or maintain a healthy speed in the longer run.


## What is clean code ?

According to **Michael Feathers**, author of **Working Effectively with Legacy Code**, 

> "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who care"
